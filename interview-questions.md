# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: 
  Conditional statements determine wether or not code can be run 
  Researched answer:
Conditional statements perform different actions for different decisions in Javascript.

else if to specify a new condition if the first condition is false
else is used as a catch all for everything else that is not met by the previous conditions.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Pair programming is set up in Driver and a Navigator. The Driver shares their screen and uses mouse and keyboard to control code input.
  The Navigator watches, advises and is responsible for high-level input to the code. Catches errors, bugs, and typos 
  Researched answer:
  Driver: Builds the project and contorls main actions of the computer. 
  Navigator: Helps the driver by answering questions. Pointing out potentioal pronblems with the project.
  Both: Switch roles regularly and are respecful of theri roles. Let each other know if they need to absent or have been away for key points in the project. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
A higher order function accepts functions as parameters and returns a function. It is called so because instead of strings, numbers, or booleans it goes higerh to operate on functions. 
2. Jest:
Jest is a Javascript Testing Framework, it works with frameworks like Angular or libraries like React and Vanilla Javascript
3. Objects:
  Objects are variables too, but contain many values. Objects can have properties, which define thier characteristics.

4. Method:
  Actions that can be performed on objects. 
5. Classes:
  Special functions that are templates for creating objects
